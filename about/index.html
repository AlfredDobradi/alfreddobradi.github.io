<p>My name is Alfred Dobradi, welcome to my crib. This is hopefully going to be my new personal blog I&rsquo;ll push on Github and all that. Seeing how all my previous efforts of writing a blog led nowhere really, I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical about this but sure look, hope springs eternal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a server engineer located in Dublin. I write a lot of code both in and out of work, other than that I usually spend my free time playing video games, making music or watching stuff with my partner. I have quite a few interests but I&rsquo;m trying to cut down on hobbies as I&rsquo;m not made of time unfortunately.</p>
<p>The plan is to write about anything that comes to my mind, coding or other IT-related stuff, music - making or consuming it - and all that jazz. I don&rsquo;t know honestly, we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
