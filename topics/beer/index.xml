Naturally when I saw they are making a non-alcoholic version I bought a pack - cause obviously they only sell it in 4-packs. Not entirely sure what I expected but it tastes just like how I remember beer tasting and that is not good at all. Not sure why people love that stuff, but oh well&amp;hellip; it was an experience.</description></item></channel></rss>
