Well, well, well back to EVE Online again. I think EVE is the game I spent the most time playing and I quit and returned more times than I can count. It&rsquo;s just intriguing, so many things happen all the time, playing it just makes time fly - no pun intended, but I&rsquo;ll take it. Today started as such a day: having fun in EVE Online.
Yesterday I decided to return.

Before I stopped drinking about 15 years ago, Guinness wasn&rsquo;t a thing at all in Hungary so I never tried it before. Naturally when I saw they are making a non-alcoholic version I bought a pack - cause obviously they only sell it in 4-packs. Not entirely sure what I expected but it tastes just like how I remember beer tasting and that is not good at all. Not sure why people love that stuff, but oh well&mldr; it was an experience.

<div class=description>
I have to admit, I haven&rsquo;t used VMs a lot in the last 5+ years or at least not directly. I&rsquo;ve been using Docker for a long time and my limited exposure to VMs were through Vagrant at my old job. The reason I dug up how to run a Debian VM using Qemu is simple: I needed a Debian VM and VirtualBox is just too damn heavy. I only needed a lightweight Debian installation to play around with eBPF and Go.

Well, here we are again. Please excuse my lack of finish on the theme, I&rsquo;ll work on it at some point I reckon (just want to add tag support). For more information, check the aboutpage, otherwise idk, not much point hanging around right now you creep.
