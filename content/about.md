My name is Alfred Dobradi, welcome to my crib. This is hopefully going to be my new personal blog I'll push on Github and all that. Seeing how all my previous efforts of writing a blog led nowhere really, I'm a bit skeptical about this but sure look, hope springs eternal.

I'm a server engineer located in Dublin. I write a lot of code both in and out of work, other than that I usually spend my free time playing video games, making music or watching stuff with my partner. I have quite a few interests but I'm trying to cut down on hobbies as I'm not made of time unfortunately.

The plan is to write about anything that comes to my mind, coding or other IT-related stuff, music - making or consuming it - and all that jazz. I don't know honestly, we'll see how it goes.
