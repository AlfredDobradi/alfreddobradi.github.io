Before I stopped drinking about 15 years ago, Guinness wasn't a thing at all in Hungary so I never tried it before. Naturally when I saw they are making a non-alcoholic version I bought a pack - cause obviously they only sell it in 4-packs. Not entirely sure what I expected but it tastes just like how I remember beer tasting and that is not good at all. Not sure why people love that stuff, but oh well... it was an experience.
