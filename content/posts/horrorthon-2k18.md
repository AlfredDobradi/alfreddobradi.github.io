Judging by the great fun I had at last year’s Horrorthon, I was pretty sure I’d get the 5 day pass as soon as they announce them. I have to say it was a long wait but it was worth it. Altogether the lineup was very solid, there were no movies I didn’t enjoy - there weren’t too much last year either anyway - and the Q&As and presentation were also very enjoyable. I won’t write tons about the movies, just a very brief review but I intend to go over every movie I’ve seen in order.

#### [Overlord](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4530422/)

I have a few things I like in movies: action, gore, WWII, weird experiments. This has all four of those. And boy is it done in a miraculous way! Acting is spot on, effects are amazing, action is just non-stop, what more you can ask for? Well nothing is the answer for me. Loved it.

#### [What Keeps You Alive](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7073710/)

I’ll be honest, I didn’t know what to expect from this. I am usually not keen on these few character slowburn thrillers but this blew me away. Perfect romantic getaway with your wife? Well think again! It was very tense all through the movie, great plot, beautiful shots as well.

#### [Camp Cold Brook](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5829032/)

Alright, alright, I still can’t decide if this movie was supposed to be dead serious or sort of a half-parody but it wasn’t bad either way. The story was great, big fan, seriously. Plot twist, same. Some magnificent shots, great use of the CCTV footage too. My biggest issue with the movie was the lack of tension and the abundance of jump scares. Didn’t ruin it, but left a sour taste. Having said that, I still liked it.

#### [The Cleaning Lady](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7044076/)

I wrote two words about this on my Twitter: “Exquisite flick” and I own it. Second few character slowburn thriller… What have I become? I loved it anyway.

#### [Framed](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5065346/)

Now this movie. This caught me off-guard. Some background info: I haven’t read anything about most of these movies before seeing them (well, the new ones anyway) so I didn’t know anything about most of them, for example this one. Now damn, this was way a bloodier movie than I thought they’d put for 3pm on a Friday. It was bloody, it was druggy, it was everything that’s wrong but it was still damn entertaining.

#### [Knuckleball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6284256/)

The Home Alone sequel everybody was waiting for. Now with actual life-threatening injuries!

#### [The Devil’s Doorway](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6793280/) with Director – Aislinn Clarke

Oh boy. I’m not a fan of found footage flicks because usually they’re subpar, but this was great. The topic was also something that I found very interesting and the way it handled the sensitive nature of it was pretty spot on. I loved how you could feel the clunkiness of the camera - as it takes place in 1960 so camcorders weren’t really a thing.

#### [Nightmare Cinema](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349910/) with Director Mick Garris

Anthology movies are the bomb and Mick Garris is a demi-god of horror so it wasn’t a huge surprise this turned out great. The movie is divided to 4 sections with different directors, the only connection is the Nightmare Cinema and Mickey Rourke (still a fucking badass). The movies are very different and all great in their own way, which makes this thing perfect.

#### [The Axiom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6051096/)

Huge mindfuck. I LOVED the story. I want to know more. Such a good movie. Can’t even say more.

#### [Living Space](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5887650/)

Another movie with a nazi in it. Fair amount of gore, but it never feels gratuitous. The plot is very enjoyable but I’d liked it better if we get more in the end. Still something I’ll probably rewatch.

#### [Horror Express](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068713/) with author John Connelly

I’ve never seen Horror Express before, only heard of it but gosh darn it was great. Had a chance to pick up a signed copy from the author and we briefly talked about the movie as well, so I’ll say what I said to him: the story was very entertaining, the actors were great and the effects were a bit dated but that’s just the way I love them. Also Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are in this so… you know… watch it.

#### [Wolfman’s Got Nards](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8206950/)

I loved the documentaries last year and I’m glad there were some this year too (well one documentary and an actual presentation, I’ll return to that shortly). I haven’t seen Monster Squad too many times and I don’t even know when the last time was but this took me back. It was such a warm feeling seeing how many people can relate to the rag-tag team of kids fighting the Universal Monsters, makes me tear up every time.

#### [Lifechanger](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7188978/)

THIS. MOVIE. Mind boggling, bloody, emotional rollercoaster with such a weird ending! I’ll need to rewatch this a few times FO SHO.

#### [Secret Santa](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6328004/) with director Adam Marcus & cast

I’m kinda sorry I used that start for the previous movie cause I’ve got nothing left to signify how amazing this flick was. Christmas horrors are very much my thang and this one did a solid on one of my most hated traditions: secret santa. I realize some people won’t like this movie because it has some “insensitive” conversation material. My two cents on this is until these nasty things are eliminated from our life, we shouldn’t ban or omit them from movies or books - unless of course it’s forced or gratuitous or just plays for the shock, obviously fuck that shit. I also talked to Adam and (I’m fairly sure) everybody from the cast and they’re super nice people, I hope they get to come back to Dublin with their next movie as well.

#### [Anna and the Apocalypse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6433880/)

This one was absolute bonkers. A zombie horror musical? Yes please!

#### [Book of Monsters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7260818/) with producer Paul Butler & cast

I love me some nice monster flick and when there’s more of them, I like them more! The detail on those monsters? fantastic. The story? Nothing wrong with it! The cast? I loved them. I wanna see Nicholas Vince in more movies. Please watch this movie.

#### Sir Christopher Frayling – On Frankenstein plus [Frankenstein And The Monster From Hell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071519/)

This was a twofer actually, first Sir Christopher Frayling gave a presentation about Frankenstein and the history of the story of the many Frankensteins through the decades - as this is the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley publishing her original story. I learned a lot of interesting facts from the block and I’m sure I wasn’t alone.

The movie was almost right after the presentation was over and it was a classic Frankenstein movie (the last Hammer Frankenstein film) with Peter Cushing and Shane Briant. I haven’t seen many Frankenstein movies in all fairness but this one was really entertaining, sewn together brilliantly.

#### [St. Agatha](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6182078/)

This movie was pretty sinister. I won’t go into the religious side of the movie although from the story perspective it’s obviously pretty important, but I’ll just say I went in for this with expecting a weird movie at best but not a good one and I was glad to see it was actually pretty good. The arch of the story was very well-written, the ending was super satisfying too.

#### Surprise Film - [Assassination Nation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6205872/)

There were some wild guesses as to what movie this would be and some people guessed right deducing from the play time and the help we got from the crew saying it’s a new movie: it was Assassination Nation. Let me tell you one thing: I loved this movie. It had some things that - similarly to Tragedy Girls - I felt I’m too old for but altogether it was good. The message about social media and people’s garbage is more important than ever and the tools they used to depict this - blowing it up obviously - were perfect for the job.

#### [Suspiria](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034415/) (2018)

Hng this movie… I thought a lot about this and I talked to a few people and everybody I discussed it with said it was too long. I have to agree. But. I can’t pinpoint one scene or cut I’d have removed and I think that’s a very unfair situation for the makers of the film. Two and a half hours are way too long for a movie, but I felt like there’s nothing that doesn’t belong. Some say the subplot about the wife was pointless, I think it explained the motivation of the old man and that’s very important. I just can’t think of 30 minutes worth of scenes that was not necessary to the movie.

#### [Killers Within](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7458872/) with directors Paul Bushe & Brian O’Neill

I like Irish horrors. I haven’t seen much of them but so far all of them were good (including the shorts as well). This one was pretty surprising. The story started out as a simple plan to get money but turned into something way more sinister I don’t want to spoil cause I didn’t see this coming and it’s good. I was complaining a bit at first, but then I realized all I’m doing is nitpicking and the things I didn’t get took nothing away from the experience. Nice. One.

#### Short Film Showcase

Let’s split this further but with shorter reviews (I wish I had links to these):

* Jar (Ireland) - Exciting, spooky, unknowny. Great short.
* The Raven (Ireland) - Classic Poe, modern interpretation. No mistakes.
* Life’s A Wish And Then You Die (Ireland) - Very short, very funny
* A Doll Distorted (UK) - Very good, liked the twist (or maybe others knew what’s going on, was a twist for me)
* An Beanshi (Ireland) - Some weird-ass halloween party that’s for sure. It was pretty funny.
* Delicacy (UK) - This was pretty obvious from the get go, but it was entertaining nevertheless
* Mannequins (UK) - I wish we knew some more to this. Clever idea.
* 5 Minutes To Midnight (Ireland) - Very funny, clever twist
* Besoin Dead (France) - Many laughs were had, good make up
* Gluten Freek (Ireland) - Absolute piss-take but very funny
* Bus To Dublin (Ireland) - My favorite short this year, laughed my pants off

#### [Ravers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7638094/)

I always wondered why raves are not more frequent locations for horror movies, the flashing lights and the music provided great background for this flick. It was very entertaining while not taking the piss out of people frequenting these gigs (presumably because the director is also such person). The plot was a bit silly but still great, perfect horror-comedy to calm the nerves.

#### [Videoman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5295774/)

This movie was a real slow burner. There wasn’t too much horror or even thriller elements to it, more like this paranoid feeling all through the flick, I’m not even sure how I should describe it. There was a bit of “action” around the end but for me this desperate, weird feeling was bringing it all together, I am looking forward to have this in some form. Probably not on VHS.

#### [Piercing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6516314/)

This movie was one of my favorites and I can’t even describe why. I love revenge flicks and this is kinda one but it’s just so much more than that. The whole movie is just mindblowing, you never know what to expect or even to trust what you think you know, a very uncomfortable feeling but how commendable of this movie that it makes you feel like that. Well very, I say.

#### [Await Further Instructions](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4971408/)

Home invasion movies? No thanks. This is not really one though. Or is it? Well I won’t tell, but I didn’t regret I stayed. It’s kinda like Piercing, you can never be sure of what you know about anything that’s happening in this movie. The plot is very tight, the acting was great and the whole movie is super tense from start to finish. Hello Ruby!

#### [One Cut Of The Dead](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7914416/)

So this is a recording of a livestream about a movie making a movie! What can go wrong, right? Well nothing did. I enjoyed this one so much, unbelievably good fun. I always like Asian horror movies - especially Japanese ones - and this one’s not gonna be an exception. Such a funny concept and the delivery is pure gold.

### Conclusion

I hope I’ll make some people watch any of these movies at some point because they were all great with 0 exceptions. The 5 days of Horrorthon this year was a great way to escape reality and spend this time watching horror movies. Getting back into life was harder than I expected but I’m already looking forward to next year.
