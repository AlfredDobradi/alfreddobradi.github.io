Well, well, well back to EVE Online again. I think EVE is the game I spent the most time playing and I quit and returned more times than I can count. It's just intriguing, so many things happen all the time, playing it just makes time fly - no pun intended, but I'll take it. Today started as such a day: having fun in EVE Online.

Yesterday I decided to return. I've been thinking about it for a while and hearing CCP might be ending scarcity over time just made it even more tempting. I jumped in after work to see where I left things. I have 2 accounts with 2 characters each and a bit of money left over from my corp days. I've decided to ditch my older account as I haven't played too much with it anyway and focus on my newer one with more skill points and more money. I looked at my ex-corp character and saw there's tons of stuff in safety so I thought the first goal should be selling or recovering as much as I can.

There was one problem: I didn't have a ship and all my stuff was in nullsec space. If you're not familiar with the terms, nullsec is pretty much what it sounds like, there's no security forces present, you can be attacked by anyone without any consequence. It's pretty exciting but also a scary place if you're not paying attention. So after seeting that, I set my waypoints and made my way towards the `HLW_HP` system. Getting there was pretty uneventful. I encountered a single warp bubble but fortunately the people who set it up were nowhere to be found so I managed to bail. Once I got to the station, I put up a lot of stuff for sale and packed the rest into my `Stiletto`. Now, that was kinda my first mistake. The claw is a tech 2 interceptor and as such it's quite expensive but my fit for it wasn't too good as I lack a lot of skills so I didn't feel too comfortable flying it but didn't want to sell it.

Before leaving the station, I wrote in [Rix](https://twitch.tv/rixraw)'s chat let's hope I can make it back in one piece. Well I didn't. One of the first things to learn when moving around in nullsec is to NEVER warp to gates directly. Find some other stellar body or station you can warp to in order to avoid potential traps. Needless to say, I forgot this rule and flew directly in a warp bubble and unlike the first encounter, this time I wasn't so lucky. Even though I managed to escape the bubble, they prevented me from jumping away and absolutely demolished my ship. And that's the story of how I lost 32.6 million ISK an hour into my supposed to be triumphant return to EVE Online. Learn from my mistake, don't warp directly.
