Naturally when I saw they are making a non-alcoholic version I bought a pack - cause obviously they only sell it in 4-packs. Not entirely sure what I expected but it tastes just like how I remember beer tasting and that is not good at all. Not sure why people love that stuff, but oh well&amp;hellip; it was an experience.</description></item><item><title>Creating a Debian virtual machine with Qemu on macOS</title><link>http://example.org/posts/virtual-qemu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 11:41:55 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/virtual-qemu/</guid><description>I have to admit, I haven&amp;rsquo;t used VMs a lot in the last 5+ years or at least not directly. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Docker for a long time and my limited exposure to VMs were through Vagrant at my old job. The reason I dug up how to run a Debian VM using Qemu is simple: I needed a Debian VM and VirtualBox is just too damn heavy. I only needed a lightweight Debian installation to play around with eBPF and Go.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>http://example.org/posts/intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 09:50:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/intro/</guid><description>Well, here we are again. Please excuse my lack of finish on the theme, I&amp;rsquo;ll work on it at some point I reckon (just want to add tag support). For more information, check the aboutpage, otherwise idk, not much point hanging around right now you creep.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>http://example.org/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 08:12:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/about/</guid><description>My name is Alfred Dobradi, welcome to my crib. This is hopefully going to be my new personal blog I&amp;rsquo;ll push on Github and all that. Seeing how all my previous efforts of writing a blog led nowhere really, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit skeptical about this but sure look, hope springs eternal.
I&amp;rsquo;m a server engineer located in Dublin. I write a lot of code both in and out of work, other than that I usually spend my free time playing video games, making music or watching stuff with my partner.</description></item></channel></rss>
